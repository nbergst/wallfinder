# WallFinder

Finds the geometric structure of a room, ie. walls and floors

## Preparations

### Doxygen
The first thing to do is to download [Brew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/ "HomeBrew") using the instructions from [here] (https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/installation "Brew installation"). The next thing is to install graphviz (using 'brew install graphviz'), and then doxygen similarily.

A build stage should already be added to the Xcode project, and will build the documentation the same time as it builds the code. The generated files will be put in 'doc/html'



## Other
A nice instruction on how to markup the README-file can be found [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax "Markdown Syntax")
