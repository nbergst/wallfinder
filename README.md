# WallFinder

Finds the geometric structure of a room, ie. walls and floors

## Preparations

### Doxygen
The first thing to do is to download [Brew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/ "HomeBrew") using the instructions from [here] (https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/installation "Brew installation"). The next thing is to install graphviz (using 'brew install graphviz'), and then doxygen similarily.

A build stage should already be added to the Xcode project, and will build the documentation the same time as it builds the code.
